====== 2. L2 - Mechanical side of AI ======
Created Sunday 04 October 2020

* Language(symbol system) and thought, what came first?
--------------------
* Alan Turing holds that the question "can machines think" too meaningless, as we need to understand/define "thinking" first.

**Turing Test**(aka **Imitation Game**)
There is a human judge chatting with an agent on the other side. If the agent cannot be distinguished from a human, then the agent is intelligent. i.e the program should be able to fool the judge.

How are such programs written:
1. General knowledge base
2. Rhetorical skills and getting around
3. Keeping in mind the weaknesses of a human. It should take time for difficult questions.
e.g ELIZA, IZAR
* Dr Weizenbaum wrote a book that AI is not possible.
--------------------
Fascination with automated entities:
1. Automata in myths
2. Robots, Chess playing Turk(a hoax actually)
3. Pascaline and Step Reckoner(by Liebnitz, very successfull)
4. Leibnitz believed much of human reasoning are a calculation

	All our ideas are:
	a. All our ideas are compounded from certain simple axioms - alphabets of human thought
	b. Complex ideas proceed from these axioms, in a mechanical way.
5. Babages idea of a programmable computer, the analytic engine(which does work) - similar to jacquard loom - It was Turing complete.
6. Ada Lovelace - wrote algorithms and realized the use of computer beyond number crunching
7. ENIAC -
