====== 3. L3 - Notion of the Mind ======
Created Sunday 04 October 2020

* How do we realize that we have a mind that has thoughts which exist independently from the world. 

**Thinking vs Reality?**
* Copernicus - What we think is not always the way things are. e.g We go around the Sun, and not vice-versa.
* Galileo - Perception is an internal process(Very correctly - like smell due to gas particles). Math is the language of the universe.
* Grandfather of AI - Thomas Hobbes - Thinking is a manipulation of symbols. Thoughts too are made of simple thoughts(atoms) which helps us think of the world. **But he couldn't answer what a symbol meant?**
--------------------
**Notion of the mind, arguments?**
* Rene Descartes  - Animals are wonderful machines, humans beings are too, except that they have a mind. He was a dualist. Other schools of thought - idealism(everything is an idea, which makes perception possible, obeys some laws too), materialism(laws of physics make our mind).** Who is manipulating the symbols inside the mind?** He then declared that he's found the proof of God, by infinte regression. 
* Notion of 'I', where does it come from? This is strange if we are just mechanistic creatures.
--------------------
* John Locke - Idea of //tabula rasa// - knowledge is derived from experience.
* David Hume - Experience and argument as the basis of logical arguments, law of mental activities(mental forces and operations act on ideas, he does not explain how). He was an empircist.
* Immanuel Kant - The mind has //a priori// principles. The mind makes the sensory data conform to our perception. Fundamentally, the minds of all humans are similar, and that is why any two humans can communicate. The world we see may be different from our sensory experience(clouds seem to be shapes, but in reallity it is just random and depends on the angle of sight). **Space and Time are absolutely necessary for thinking. Our minds think in terms of space and time.**

* We see the world from the prism of our minds.
--------------------
**Ontology** - Talks about what exists and what can be said to exist.
**Epistemology** - How do we acquire knowledge of the world, facts?
